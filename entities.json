        "abstract": "Locomotion,the most basic interaction in Virtual Environments (VE), enables users to move around the virtual world. Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) is a problem which has not been solved completely since existing techniques have a specific set of requirements and limitations. In addition, the uncertainty about the impact that virtual cues have on users perception complicates the development of better locomotion interfaces. A broadly applicable locomotion technique that is easy to use and addresses the issues of presence, cybersickness and fatigue has yet to be developed. Though optical flow and vestibular cues are dominant in navigation, other cues such as auditory, arm feedback, wind, etc. play a role. The proposed research aims to evaluate and improve upon a set of locomotion techniques for different modes of locomotion in virtual scenarios, as well as the transitions between them. The outcome measures of the evaluations of the different scenarios are usefulness for spatial orientation, presence, fatigue, cybersickness and user preference. The envisioned contribution of my thesis is research towards the design of a locomotion technique that is easy to use and addresses the shortcomings of current implementations.",

        "abstract": "People often run into barriers when doing creative tasks with software because it is difficult to translate goals into concrete actions. While expert-made tutorials, examples, and documentation abound online, finding the most relevant content and adapting it to one’s own situation and task is a challenge. My research introduces techniques for exposing relevant examples to novices in the context of their own workflows. These techniques are embodied in three systems. The first, RePlay, helps people find solutions when stuck by automatically locating relevant moments from expert-made videos. The second, DiscoverySpace, helps novices get started by mining and recommending expert-made software macros. The third, CritiqueKit, helps novices improve their work by providing ambient guidance and recommendations. Preliminary experiments with RePlay suggest that contextual video clips help people complete targeted tasks. Controlled experiments with DiscoverySpace and CritiqueKit demonstrate that software macros prevent novices from losing confidence, and ambient guidance improves novice output. My research illustrates the power of user communities to support creative learning.",

People are willing to invest in expensive cameras as a medium for their artistic expression, but few have access to in-person classes. Inspired by critique sessions common in in-person art practice classes, we propose design principles for creative learning. My dissertation research focuses on designing new interfaces and interactions that provide contextual in-camera feedback to aid users in learning visual elements of photography. We interactively visualize results of image processing algorithms as additional information for the user to make more informed and intentional decisions during capture. In this paper, we describe our design principles, and apply these principles in the design of two guided photography interfaces: one to explore lighting options for a portrait, and one to refine contents and composition of a photo.

Screen sizes of such devices are becoming larger and smaller to accommodate both intimate and practical uses. Some mobile device screens are becoming larger to accommodate new experiences (e.g., phablet, tablet, eReader), whereas screen sizes on wearable devices are becoming smaller to allow them to fit into more places (e.g., smartwatch, wrist-band and eye-wear). However, these trends are making it difficult to use such devices with only one hand due to their placement, limited thumb reach and the fat-finger problem. This is especially true as there are many occasions when a user's other hand is occupied (encumbered) or not available.\nThis thesis work explores, creates and studies novel interaction techniques that enable effective single-hand usage on mobile and wearable devices, empowering users to achieve more with their smart devices when only one hand is available.",

I believe that shape-changing interfaces will be increasingly available to end-users in the future. To increase acceptance of shape-changing interfaces by end-users, we need to provide designers with design criteria and framework closely grounded on their current skills and needs. Also, we need to provide them with prototyping tools to enable quick assessment of ideas in the physical world. In this paper, I introduce the three threads of my Ph.D. research in the direction of providing the design tools. First, I advance existing shape-changing interface taxonomies to broaden design vocabulary and systemize design framework, based on the classification of everyday objects. Second, I conduct a study with end-users to suggest interaction techniques and design guidelines for shape-changing interfaces from their current practice. Lastly, I develop a physical prototyping tool for shape-changing interfaces to shorten prototyping iterations based on well-known Lego-like bricks.",

        "abstract": "As interactions move beyond the desktop, interactive behaviours (effects of actions as they happen, or once they happen) are becoming increasingly complex. This complexity is due to the variety of forms that objects might take, and the different inputs and sensors capturing information, and the ability to create nuanced responses to those inputs. Current interaction design tools do not support much of this rich behaviour authoring. In my work I create prototyping tools that examine ways in which designers can create interactive behaviours. Thus far, I have created two prototyping tools: Pineal and Astral, which examine how to create physical forms based on a smart object’s behaviour, and how to reuse existing desktop infrastructures to author different kinds of interactive behaviour. I also contribute conceptual elements, such as how to create smart objects using mobile devices, their sensors and outputs, instead of using custom electronic circuits, as well as devising evaluation strategies used in HCI toolkit research which directly informs my approach to evaluating my tools.

We present Scout, a system that helps designers explore many variations rapidly through mixed-initiative interaction with high-level constraints and design feedback. Past constraint-based layout systems use low-level spatial constraints and mostly produce only a single design. Scout advances upon these systems by introducing high-level constraints based on design concepts (e.g. emphasis). With Scout, we have formalized several high-level constraints into their corresponding low-level spatial constraints to enable rapidly generating many designs through constraint solving and program synthesis.",

Haptic feedback is also presented on the user's feet that correlate with the touched objects on the robotic hands, creating a closed-loop system.

Most of these solutions were immersion breaking due to their encumbering and uncomfortable design and build around a single actuator type, thus limiting the overall fidelity and flexibility of the haptic feedback. We present Face/On, a VR HMD face cushion with three types of discreetly embedded actuators that provide rich haptic feedback without encumbering users with invasive instrumentation on the body. By combining vibro-tactile and thermal feedback with electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), Face/On can simulate a wide range of scenarios and benefit from synergy effects between these feedback types.",

However, there are problems, such as difficulty attaching and detaching the devices and hindrances to free finger movement. To solve these issues, we developed “Haptopus,” which embeds a tactile display in the HMD and presents tactile sensations to the face. In this paper, we conducted a preliminary investigation on the best suction pressure and compared Haptopus to conventional tactile presentation approaches. As a result, we confirmed that Haptopus improves the quality of the VR experience.",

AccordionFab is a fabrication method in which the user can prototype multi-layered inflatable structures rapidly with a common laser cutter. Our key finding is that it is possible to selectively weld the two uppermost plastic sheets out of the stacked sheets by defocusing the laser and inserting the heat-resistant paper below the desired welding layer.  As the contribution of our research, we investigated the optimal distance between the lens and the workpiece for cutting and welding and developed an attachment which supports welding process. Next, we developed a mechanism of changing the thickness and bending angle of multi-layered objects and created a simulation software. Using these techniques, the user can create various prototypes such as personal furniture that fits user's body and packing containers that fit the contents.",

        "abstract": "Recent years saw an explosion in Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for consumers. These experiences can be classified based on the scale of the interactive area (room vs city/global scale) , or the fidelity of the experience (high vs low). Experiences that target large areas, such as campus or world scale, commonly have only rudimentary interactions with the physical world, and suffer from registration errors and jitter. We classify these experiences as large scale and low fidelity. On the other hand, various room sized experiences feature realistic interaction of virtual content with the real world. We classify these experiences as small scale and high fidelity. Our work is the first to explore the domain of large scale high fidelity (LSHF) AR experiences. We build upon the small scale high fidelity capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens to allow LSHF interactions. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system with a game specifically designed for LSHF interactions, handling many challenges and limitations unique to the domain of LSHF AR through the game design. Our contributions are twofold:  - The lessons learned during the design and development of a system capable of LSHF AR interactions. - Identification of a set of reusable game elements specific to LSHF AR, including mechanisms for addressing spatiotemporal\ninconsistencies and crowd control. We believe our contributions will be fully applicable not only to games, but all LSHF AR experiences.",

We showed that TES can elicit a force sensation, and adjusting the current parameters can control the amount of the sensation. Unlike electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), which can also present force sensation by stimulating motor nerves to contract muscles, TES is thought to present a proprioceptive force sensation by stimulating receptors or sensory nerves responsible for recognizing the magnitude of the muscle contraction existing inside the tendon. In the demo, we offer the occasion for trying TES.",

Our proposal uses frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) to realize a touch pad on the external surfaces of the HMD case; no special devices are needed.  As simple FTIR approaches do not suit SbHMDs due to the spatial relation between camera and light, we design an arrangement of acrylic plates and mirror suitable for smartphone's built-in camera and torch-light.

Currently, most approaches for locomotion in VR use either concepts like teleportation for traveling longer distances or present a virtual motion that creates a visual-vestibular conflict, which is assumed to cause simulator sickness. With our platform we evaluated two designs for using the rotation of a motorized swivel chair to alleviate this, emph{wiggle} and emph{impulse}. Our evaluation showed that emph{impulse}, using short rotation bursts matched with the visual acceleration, can significantly reduce simulator sickness and increase the perception of self-motion compared to no physical motion.",

Our sensor design is both stretchable and flexible/bendable and can thus conform to a large variety of three-dimensional surface geometries, including shape-changing surfaces. We briefly outline an approach for basic signal acquisition from such sensors and how they can be leveraged to measure internal air-pressure of inflatable objects without a need for specialized air-pressure sensors. We further demonstrate how rigid electronic components can be mounted inside malleable inflatable objects without the need for dedicated enclosures for mechanical protection.",

The method utilizes the haptic illusion evoked from proper haptic cues in respect of the analog button's movement to change the perceived physical property of the button. Two types of analog buttons, joystick and trigger button on the gamepad is augmented with localized haptic feedback. We implemented two virtual textures for each type of analog button, and these textures could be programmatically controlled reflecting the dynamic game situations. We also demonstrate a two-player shooter game to show the dynamic texture representation of customized gamepad could enrich the game experience.",

        "abstract": "We present six rotary knobs, each with a distinct shape, that provide haptic force feedback on rotation. The knob shapes were evaluated in relation to twelve haptic feedback stimuli. The stimuli were designed as a combination of the most relevant perceptual parameters of force feedback; acceleration, friction, detent amplitude and spacing. The results indicate that there is a relationship between the shape of a knob and its haptic feedback. The perceived functionality can be dynamically altered by changing its shape and haptic feedback. This work serves as basis for the design of dynamic interface controls that can adapt their shape and haptic feel to the content that is controlled.  In our demonstration, we show the six distinct knobs shapes with the different haptic feedback stimuli. Attendees can experience the interaction with the different knob shapes in relation the stimuli and design stimuli with a graphical editor.\n",

The mechanism of FacePush is obtained by shifting torques provided by two motors that press upon a user’s face via utilization of a pulley system. FacePush can generate normal forces of varying strengths and apply those to the surface of the face. To inform our design of FacePush for noticeable and discernible normal forces in VR applications, we conducted two studies to iden- tify the absolute detection threshold and the discrimination threshold for users’ perception. After further consideration in regard to user comfort, we determined that two levels of force, 2.7 kPa and 3.375 kPa, are ideal for the development of the FacePush experience via implementation with three applications which demonstrate use of discrete and continuous normal force for the actions of boxing, diving, and 360 guidance in virtual reality. In addition, with regards to a virtual boxing application, we conducted a user study evaluating the user experience in terms of enjoyment and realism and collected the user’s feedback.",

        "abstract": "Keyboard shortcuts can be more efficient than graphical input, but they are underused by most users. To alleviate this, we present \"Guided Finger-Aware Shortcuts\" to reduce the gulf between graphical input and shortcut activation. The interaction technique works by recognising when a special hand posture is used to press a key, then allowing secondary finger movements to select among related shortcuts if desired. Novice users can learn the mappings through dynamic visual guidance revealed by holding a key down, but experts can trigger shortcuts directly without pausing. Two variations are described: FingerArc uses the angle of the thumb, and FingerChord uses a second key press. The techniques are motivated by an interview study identifying factors hindering the learning, use, and exploration of keyboard shortcuts. A controlled comparison with conventional keyboard shortcuts shows the techniques encourage overall shortcut usage, make interaction faster, less error-prone, and provide advantages over simply adding visual guidance to standard shortcuts.",

Most of these applications share two key limitations: a) the complexity of the sound fields that can be produced is limited by the physical size of the transducers, and b) no obstacles can be present between the transducers and the control point. We present SoundBender, a hybrid system that overcomes these limitations by combining the versatility of phased arrays of Transducers (PATs) with the precision of acoustic metamaterials. In this paper, we explain our approach to design and implement such hybrid modulators (i.e. to create complex sound fields) and methods to manipulate the field dynamically (i.e. stretch, steer). We demonstrate our concept using self-bending beams enabling both levitation and tactile feedback around an obstacle and present example applications enabled by SoundBender.",

We then present ElectroTutor, a tutorial system that implements a range of tests for both the software and physical aspects of a physical computing system.

Our system computes a motion sculpture from an input video, and then embeds it back into the scene in a 3D-aware fashion. The user may also explore the sculpture directly in 3D or physically print it. Our interactive interface allows users to customize the sculpture design, for example, by selecting materials and lighting conditions.\n\nTo provide this end-to-end workflow, we introduce an algorithm\nthat estimates a human’s 3D geometry over time from a\nset of 2D images, and develop a 3D-aware image-based rendering\napproach that inserts the sculpture back into the original\nvideo. By automating the process, our system takes motion\nsculpture creation out of the realm of professional artists, and\nmakes it applicable to a wide range of existing video material.\n\nBy conveying 3D information to users, motion sculptures reveal\nspace-time motion information that is difficult to perceive\nwith the naked eye, and allow viewers to interpret how different\nparts of the object interact over time.

Second, most users are unfamiliar with these features and do not know what to expect. Finally, the interface for operating these features is not intuitive. To help drivers understand ADAS features, we present a conversational in-vehicle digital assistant that responds to drivers' questions and commands in natural language. With the system prototyped herein, drivers can ask questions or command using unconstrained natural language in the vehicle, and the assistant trained by using advanced machine learning techniques, coupled with access to vehicle signals, responds in real-time based on conversational context.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we define the concept of exploratory labeling: the use of computational and interactive methods to help analysts categorize groups of documents into a set of unknown and evolving labels. While many computational methods exist to analyze data and build models once the data is organized around a set of predefined categories or labels, few methods address the problem of reliably discovering and curating such labels in the first place. In order to move first steps towards bridging this gap, we propose an interactive visual data analysis method that integrates human-driven label ideation, specification and refinement with machine-driven recommendations. The proposed method enables the user to progressively discover and ideate labels in an exploratory fashion and specify rules that can be used to automatically match sets of documents to labels. To support this process of ideation, specification, as well as evaluation of the labels, we use unsupervised machine learning methods that provide suggestions and data summaries. We evaluate our method by applying it to a real-world labeling problem as well as through controlled user studies to identify and reflect on patterns of interaction emerging from exploratory labeling activities.",

        "abstract": "While crowdsourcing enables data collection at scale, ensuring high-quality data remains a challenge. In particular, effective task design underlies nearly every reported crowdsourcing success, yet remains difficult to accomplish. Task design is hard because it involves a costly iterative process: identifying the kind of work output one wants, conveying this information to workers, observing worker performance, understanding what remains ambiguous, revising the instructions, and repeating the process until the resulting output is satisfactory.\n\nTo facilitate this process, we propose a novel meta-workflow that helps requesters optimize crowdsourcing task designs and Sprout, our open-source tool, which implements this workflow. Sprout improves task designs by (1) eliciting points of confusion from crowd workers, (2) enabling requesters to quickly understand these misconceptions and the overall space of questions, and (3) guiding requesters to improve the task design in response. We report the results of a user study with two labeling tasks demonstrating that requesters strongly prefer Sprout and produce higher-rated instructions compared to current best practices for creating gated instructions (instructions plus a workflow for training and testing workers). We also offer a set of design recommendations for future tools that support crowdsourcing task design.",

We verify the feasibility of Lip-Interact with three user experiments: evaluating the recognition accuracy, comparing with touch on input efficiency, and comparing with voiced commands with regards to personal privacy and social norms.

This style of interactive media has the potential to engage a large audience and more clearly explain concepts, but is expensive and time consuming to produce. Drawing on industry experience and interviews with domain experts, we contribute design tools to make it easier to author and publish interactive articles. We introduce Idyll, a novel \"compile-to-the-web\" language for web-based interactive narratives. Idyll implements a flexible article model, allowing authors control over document style and layout, reader-driven events (such as button clicks and scroll triggers), and a structured interface to JavaScript components. Through both examples and first-use results from undergraduate computer science students, we show how Idyll reduces the amount of effort and custom code required to create interactive articles.\n",

We present redirected teleportation; an improved version of teleportation that uses iterative non-obtrusive reorientation and repositioning using a portal to redirect the user back to the center of the tracking space, where available walking space is larger. A user study compares the effectiveness, accuracy, and usability of redirected teleportation with regular teleportation using a navigation task in three different environments.  Results show that redirected teleportation allows for a better utilization of available tracking space than regular teleportation, as it requires significantly fewer teleportations, while users walk more and use a larger portion of the available tracking space.

To ease this transition, we propose the idea of cross-application bridges that start with the interface of a familiar application, and gradually change their interaction model, tools, conventions, and appearance to resemble that of an application to be learned. To investigate this idea, we developed Blocks-to-CAD, a cross-application bridge from Minecraft-style games to 3D solid modeling. A user study of our system demonstrated that our modifications to the game did not hurt enjoyment or increase cognitive load, and that players could successfully apply knowledge and skills learned in the game to tasks in a popular 3D solid modeling application. The process of developing Blocks-to-CAD also revealed eight design strategies that can be applied to design cross-application bridges for other applications and domains.",

        "abstract": "SilentVoice is a new voice input interface device that penetrates the speech-based natural user interface (NUI) in daily life. The proposed \"ingressive speech\" method enables placement of a microphone very close to the front of the mouth without suffering from pop-noise, capturing very soft speech sounds with a good S/N ratio. It realizes ultra-small (less than 39dB(A)) voice leakage, allowing us to use voice input without annoying surrounding people in public and mobile situations as well as offices and homes. By measuring airflow direction, SilentVoice can easily be separated from normal utterances with 98.8% accuracy; no activation words are needed. It can be used for voice-activated systems with a specially trained voice recognizer; evaluation results yield word error rates (WERs) of 1.8% (speaker-dependent condition), and 7.0% (speaker-independent condition) with a limited dictionary of 85 command sentences. A whisper-like natural voice can also be used for real-time voice communication.",

Users interact with DualPanto by operating the me handle with one hand and by holding on to the it handle with the other hand. Each handle is connected to a pantograph haptic input/output device. The key feature is that the two handles are spatially registered with respect to each other. When guiding their avatar through a virtual world using the me handle, spatial registration enables users to track moving objects by having the device guide the output hand. This allows blind players of a 1-on-1 soccer game to race for the ball or evade an opponent; it allows blind players of a shooter game to aim at an opponent and dodge shots. In our user study, blind participants reported very high enjoyment when using the device to play (6.5/7).",

        "abstract": "We present TrussFormer, an integrated end-to-end system that allows users to 3D print large-scale kinetic structures, i.e., structures that involve motion and deal with dynamic forces. TrussFormer builds on TrussFab, from which it inherits the ability to create static large-scale truss structures from 3D printed connectors and PET bottles. TrussFormer adds movement to these structures by placing linear actuators into them: either manually, wrapped in reusable components called assets, or by demonstrating the intended movement. TrussFormer verifies that the resulting structure is mechanically sound and will withstand the dynamic forces resulting from the motion. To fabricate the design, TrussFormer generates the underlying hinge system that can be printed on standard desktop 3D printers.  We demonstrate TrussFormer with several example objects, including a 6 legged walking robot and a 4m tall animatronics dinosaur with 5 degrees of freedom.",

        "abstract": "Smart and responsive environments rely on the ability to detect physical events, such as appliance use and human activities. Currently, to sense these types of events, one must either upgrade to “smart” appliances, or attach aftermarket sensors to existing objects. These approaches can be expensive, intrusive and inflexible. In this work, we present Vibrosight, a new approach to sense activities across entire rooms using long-range laser vibrometry. Unlike a microphone, our approach can sense physical vibrations at one specific point, making it robust to interference from other activities and noisy environments. This property enables detection of simultaneous activities, which has proven challenging in prior work. Through a series of evaluations, we show that Vibrosight can offer high accuracies at long range, allowing our sensor to be placed in an inconspicuous location. We also explore a range of additional uses, including data transmission, sensing user input and modes of appliance operation, and detecting human movement and activities on work surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Despite sound being a rich source of information, computing devices with microphones do not leverage audio to glean useful insights about their physical and social context. For example, a smart speaker sitting on a kitchen countertop cannot figure out if it is in a kitchen, let alone know what a user is doing in a kitchen – a missed opportunity. In this work, we describe a novel, real-time, sound-based activity recognition system. We start by taking an existing, state-of-the-art sound labeling model, which we then tune to classes of interest by drawing data from professional sound effect libraries traditionally used in the entertainment industry. These well-labeled and high-quality sounds are the perfect atomic unit for data augmentation, including amplitude, reverb, and mixing, allowing us to exponentially grow our tuning data in realistic ways. We quantify the performance of our approach across a range of environments and device categories and show that microphone-equipped computing devices already have the requisite capability to unlock real-time activity recognition comparable to human accuracy.",

Prior work in this field has focused on using either the visual or haptic sensory modality for providing such guidance, and results have indicated that either option may be preferable depending upon the user's specific needs. However, conventional methods involve selecting a single modality based on which will work best with the task the user is most likely to perform and using this modality throughout the duration of the navigation. In this paper, we describe the design and results of a study intended to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive modality selection algorithm that dynamically selects a navigation system's directional guidance modality while considering both task-specific benefits and the time-varying effects of switching cost, stimulus-specific adaptation, and habituation. Our findings indicate that use of this algorithm can improve user performance in the presence of multiple simultaneous tasks.",

Because mobile devices have small screens and are often used in divided attention scenarios, people are limited to using them for short, simple tasks; complex tasks like editing a document present significant challenges in this environment. In this paper we demonstrate how a complex task requiring focused attention can be adapted to the fragmented way people work while mobile by decomposing the task into smaller, simpler microtasks. We introduce Play Write, a microproductivity tool that allows people to edit Word documents from their phones via such microtasks. When participants used Play Write while simultaneously watching a video, we found that they strongly preferred its microtask-based editing approach to the traditional editing experience offered by Mobile Word. Play Write made participants feel more productive and less stressed, and they completed more edits with it. Our findings suggest microproductivity tools like Play Write can help people be productive in divided attention scenarios.",

        "abstract": "We present an interactive tool to animate the visual elements of a static picture, based on simple sketch-based markup. While animated images enhance websites, infographics, logos, e-books, and social media, creating such animations from still pictures is difficult for novices and tedious for experts. Creating automatic tools is challenging due to ambiguities in object segmentation, relative depth ordering, and non-existent temporal information. With a few user drawn scribbles as input, our mixed initiative creative interface extracts repetitive texture elements in an image, and supports animating them. Our system also facilitates the creation of multiple layers to enhance depth cues in the animation. Finally, after analyzing the artwork during segmentation, several animation processes automatically generate kinetic textures that are spatio-temporally coherent with the source image. Our results, as well as feedback from our user evaluation, suggest that our system effectively allows illustrators and animators to add life to still images in a broad range of visual styles.",

Magnetic force has not been efficiently explored in haptic design because it is not intuitive and there is a lack of methods to associate or visualize magnetic force with haptic sensations, especially for complex magnetic patterns. To represent the haptic sensations of magnetic force intuitively, magneto-haptics formularizes haptic potential from the distribution of magnetic force along the path of motion. It provides a rapid way to compute the relationship between the magnetic phenomena and the haptic mechanism. Thus, we can convert a magnetic force distribution into a haptic sensation model, making the design of magnet-embedded haptic sensations more efficient. We demonstrate three applications of magneto-haptics through interactive interfaces and devices. We further verify our theory by evaluating some magneto-haptic designs through experiments.",

Examples include elements that fail to provide alternative text for a screen reader, navigation orders that are difficult, or custom widgets that leave key functionality inaccessible. Social annotation techniques have demonstrated compelling approaches to such accessibility concerns in the web, but have been difficult to apply in mobile apps because of the challenges of robustly annotating interfaces. This research develops methods for robust annotation of mobile app interface elements. Designed for use in runtime interface modification, our methods are based in screen identifiers, element identifiers, and screen equivalence heuristics. We implement initial developer tools for annotating mobile app accessibility metadata, evaluate our current screen equivalence heuristics in a dataset of 2038 screens collected from 50 mobile apps, present three case studies implementing runtime repair of common accessibility issues, and examine repair of real-world accessibility issues in 26 apps. These contributions overall demonstrate strong opportunities for social annotation in mobile accessibility.",

        "abstract": "Performance animation is an expressive method for animating characters through human performance. However, character motion is only one part of creating animated stories. The typical workflow also involves writing a script, coordinating actors, and editing recorded performances. In most cases, these steps are done in isolation with separate tools, which introduces friction and hinders iteration. We propose TakeToons, a script-driven approach that allows authors to annotate standard scripts with relevant animation events like character actions, camera positions, and scene backgrounds. We compile this script into a story model that persists throughout the production process and provides a consistent structure for organizing and assembling recorded performances and propagating script or timing edits to existing recordings. TakeToons enables writing, performing and editing to happen in an integrated and interleaved manner that streamlines production and facilitates iteration. Informal feedback from professional animators suggests that our approach can benefit many existing workflows supporting individual authors and production teams with many different contributors.",

        "abstract": "Makers often create both physical and digital prototypes to explore a design, taking advantage of the subtle feel of physical materials and the precision and power of digital models. We introduce ShapeMe, a novel smart material that captures its own geometry as it is physically cut by an artist or designer. ShapeMe includes a software toolkit that lets its users generate customized, embeddable sensors that can accommodate various object shapes. As the designer works on a physical prototype, the toolkit streams the artist's physical changes to its digital counterpart in a 3D CAD environment.\nWe use a rapid, inexpensive and simple-to-manufacture inkjet printing technique to create embedded sensors. We successfully created a linear predictive model of the sensors' lengths, and our empirical tests of ShapeMe show an average accuracy of 2 to 3 mm. We present two application scenarios for modeling multi-object constructions, such as architectural models, and 3D models consisting of multiple layers stacked one on top of each other. ShapeMe demonstrates a novel technique for integrating digital and physical modeling, and suggests new possibilities for creating shape-aware materials.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a technique enabling distributed batteryless near-field identification (ID) between two passive radio frequency ID (RFID) tags. Each conventional ultra-high-frequency (UHF) RFID tag is modified by connecting its antenna and chip to a reed switch and then attaching a magnet to one of the reed switch's terminals, thus transforming it into an always-on switch. When the two modules approach each other, the magnets counteract each other and turn off both switches at the same time. The coabsence of IDs thus indicates a unique interaction event. In addition to sensing, the module also provides native haptic feedback through magnetic repulsion force, enabling users to perceive the system's state eyes-free, without physical constraints. Additional visual feedback can be provided through an energy-harvesting module and a light emitting diode. This specific hardware design supports contactless, orientation-invariant sensing, with a form factor compact enough for embedded and wearable use in ubiquitous computing applications.",

In this paper, we present Crowdsensus, a crowd-powered tool that enables researchers to efficiently analyze the results of elicitation studies using subjective human judgment and automatic clustering algorithms. In addition to our own analysis, we asked six expert researchers with experience running and analyzing elicitation studies to analyze an end-user elicitation dataset of 10 functions for operating a web-browser, each with 43 voice commands elicited from end-users for a total of 430 voice commands. We used Crowdsensus to gather similarity judgments of these same 430 commands from 410 online crowd workers. The crowd outperformed the experts by arriving at the same results for seven of eight functions and resolving a function where the experts failed to agree. Also, using Crowdsensus was about four times faster than using experts. ",

        "abstract": "Novel interactions that capacitively couple electromagnetic (EM) fields between devices and the human body are gaining more attention in the human-computer interaction community. One class of these techniques is Body Channel Communication (BCC), a method that overlays physical touch with digital information. Despite the number of published capacitive sensing and communication prototypes, there exists no guideline on how to design such hardware or what are the application limitations and possibilities. Specifically, wearable (groundless) BCC has been proven in the past to be extremely challenging to implement. Additionally, the exact behavior of the human body as an EM-field medium is still not fully understood today. Consequently, the application domain of BCC technology could not be fully explored.\n\nThis paper addresses this problem. Based on a recently published general purpose wearable BCC system, we first present a thorough evaluation of the impact of various technical parameter choices and an exhaustive channel characterization of the human body as a host for BCC. Second, we discuss the implications of these results for the application design space and present guidelines for future wearable BCC systems and their applications. Third, we point out an important observation of the measurements, namely that BCC can employ the whole body as user interface (and not just hands or feet). We sketch several applications with these novel interaction modalities.",

The prototype focuses on the visualization of significant weather charts, which are utilized during flight preparation. An online user study is conducted to compare the prototype with today's 2D paper maps. A total of 64 pilots from an internationally operating airline participated in the study. Among the major findings of the study is that the prototype significantly decreased the cognitive load, and enhanced spatial awareness and usability.

        "abstract": "We propose using a single slip tactile pixel on virtual reality controllers to produce sensations of finger sliding and textures. When a user moves the controller on a virtual surface, we add a slip opposite to the movement, creating an illusion of a finger that is sliding on the surface, while varying the slip feedback changes lateral forces on fingertip. When coupled with hand motion the lateral forces can be used to create perceptions of artificial textures. RollingStone has been implemented as a prototype VR controller consisting of a ball-based slip display positioned under the user’s fingertip. Within the slip display, a pair of motors actuates the ball, which is capable of gener- ating both short- and long-term two-degree-of-freedom slip feedback. An exploratory study was conducted to ensure that changing the relative motion between the finger and the ball could alter the perceptions conveying the properties of a tex- ture. The following two perception-based studies examined the minimum changes in speed of slip and angle of slip that are detectable by users. The results help us to design haptic patterns as well as our prototype applications. Finally, our preliminary user evaluation indicated that participants wel- comed RollingStone as a useful addition to the range of VR controllers.",

When a user's hand encounters a virtual object, an airbag of appropriate shape, ready for grasping, is inflated by way of the use of air pumps; the airbag then deflates when the object is no longer in play. Since PuPoP is a physical prop, it can provide the full sensation of touch to enhance the sense of realism for VR object manipulation. For this paper, we first explored the design and implementation of PuPoP with multiple shape structures. We then conducted two user studies to further understand its applicability. The first study shows that, when in conflict, visual sensation tends to dominate over touch sensation, allowing a prop with a fixed size to represent multiple virtual objects with similar sizes. The second study compares PuPoP with controllers and free-hand manipulation in two VR applications. The results suggest that utilization of dynamically-changing PuPoP, when grasped by users in line with the shapes of virtual objects, enhances enjoyment and realism. We believe that PuPoP is a simple yet effective way to convey haptic shapes in VR.",

With an initial exploratory study, we provide an initial set of dynamic and static auricular postures. Using these results, we examined the relationship between emotions and auricular postures, noting that dynamic postures involving stretching the top helix in fast (e.g., 2Hz) and slow speeds (1Hz) conveyed intense and mild pleasantness while static postures involving bending the side or top helix towards the center of the ear were associated with intense and mild unpleasantness. Based on the results, we developed a prototype (called Orrechio) with miniature motors, custom-made robotic arms and other electronic components. A preliminary user evaluation showed that participants feel more comfortable using expressive auricular postures with people they are familiar with, and that it is a welcome addition to the vocabulary of human body language.",

        "abstract": "Currently, “walkable” virtual reality (VR) is achieved by dedicating a room-sized space for VR activities, which is not shared with non-HMD users engaged in their own activities. To achieve the goal of allowing shared use of space for all users while overcoming the obvious difficulty of integrating use with those immersed in a VR experience, we present ShareSpace, a system that allows external users to communicate their needs for physical space to those wearing an HMD and immersed in their VR experience. ShareSpace works by allowing external users to place “shields” in the virtual environment by using a set of physical shield tools. A pad visualizer helps this process by allowing external users to examine the arrangement of virtual shields. We also discuss interaction techniques that minimize the interference between the respective activities of the HMD wearers and the other users of the same physical space. To evaluate our design, a user study was conducted to collect user feedback from participants in four trial scenarios. The results indicate that our ShareSpace system allows users to perform their respective activities with improved engagement and safety. In addition, this study shows that while the HMD users did perceive a considerable degree of interference due to the internal visual indications from the ShareSpace system, they were still more engaged in their VR experience than when interrupted by direct external physical interference initiated by external users.\n",

We furthermore discuss the unique design challenges of WSM, including the dimension of space reduction and the recognition of the reduced space in relation to the real space.

        "abstract": "Modern web development is rife with complexity at all layers, ranging from needing to configure backend services to grappling with frontend frameworks and dependencies. To lower these development barriers, we introduce a technique that enables people to prototype opportunistically by borrowing pieces of desired functionality from across the web without needing any access to their underlying codebases, build environments, or server backends. We implemented this technique in a browser extension called Fusion, which lets users create web UI mashups by extracting components from existing unmodified webpages and hooking them together using transclusion and JavaScript glue code. We demonstrate the generality and versatility of Fusion via a case study where we used it to create seven UI mashups in domains such as programming tools, data science, web design, and collaborative work. Our mashups include replicating portions of prior HCI systems (Blueprint for in-situ code search and DS.js for in-browser data science), extending the p5.js IDE for Processing with real-time collaborative editing, and integrating Python Tutor code visualizations into static tutorials. These UI mashups each took less than 15 lines of JavaScript glue code to create with Fusion.\n",

        "abstract": "It can be hard for tutorial creators to get fine-grained feedback about how learners are actually stepping through their tutorials and which parts lead to the most struggle. To provide such feedback for technical software tutorials, we introduce the idea of tutorial profiling, which is inspired by software code profiling. We prototyped this idea in a system called Porta that automatically tracks how users navigate through a tutorial webpage and what actions they take on their computer such as running shell commands, invoking compilers, and logging into remote servers. Porta surfaces this trace data in the form of profiling visualizations that augment the tutorial with heatmaps of activity hotspots and markers that expand to show event details, error messages, and embedded screencast videos of user actions. We found through a user study of 3 tutorial creators and 12 students who followed their tutorials that Porta enabled both the tutorial creators and the students to provide more specific, targeted, and actionable feedback about how to improve these tutorials. Porta opens up possibilities for performing user testing of technical documentation in a more systematic and scalable way.",

How can we enable designers, engineers, and roboticists to design robot behaviors that adhere to human social norms and do not result in interaction breakdowns? In this paper, we use automated formal-verification methods to facilitate the encoding of appropriate social norms into the interaction design of social robots and the detection of breakdowns and norm violations in order to prevent them. We have developed an authoring environment that utilizes these methods to provide developers of social-robot applications with feedback at design time and evaluated the benefits of their use in reducing such breakdowns and violations in human-robot interactions. Our evaluation with application developers (N=9) shows that the use of formal-verification methods increases designers' ability to identify and contextualize social-norm violations.

Harvested power from all photodiodes are aggregated to drive the whole gesture-recognition module including the micro-controller running the recognition algorithm. We design robust, lightweight algorithm to recognize finger gestures in the presence of ambient light fluctuations. We fabricate two prototypes to facilitate user’s interaction with smart glasses and smart watch. Results show 99.7%/98.3% overall precision/recall in recognizing five gestures on glasses and 99.2%/97.5% precision/recall in recognizing seven gestures on the watch. The system consumes 34.6 µW/74.3 µW for the glasses/watch and thus can be powered by the energy harvested from ambient light. We also test system’s robustness under varying light intensities, light directions, and ambient light fluctuations, where the system maintains high recognition accuracy (> 96%) in all tested settings.

When designing environments with optimal conditions for such a process various aspects like contrast, screen reflection and background light have to be considered. As shown in previous research, applying virtual environments in combination with a Head-Mounted Display for diagnostic imaging provides potential benefits to reduce issues of bad posture and diagnostic mistakes. However, there is little research in exploring the usability and user experience of such beneficial environments.\n\nIn this work we designed and evaluated different means of interaction to increase radiologists' performance. Therefore we created a virtual reality radiology reading room and employed it to evaluate three different interaction techniques. These allow a direct, semi-direct and indirect manipulation for performing scrolling- and windowing- tasks which are the most important for a radiologist.\n\nA study including nine radiologists was conducted and evaluated using the User Experience Questionnaire. Results indicate that direct manipulation is the preferred interaction technique, it outscored the other two control possibilities in attractiveness and pragmatic quality.",

We propose Motion Codes, a passive tagging mechanism that is based on the kinesthetic motion of the user's hand. Here, the tag comprises of a visual pattern that is displayed on a physical surface. To scan the tag and receive the encoded information, the user simply traces their finger over the pattern. The user wears an inertial motion sensing (IMU) ring on the finger that records the traced pattern. We design two motion code schemes, Asterisk and Obelisk that rely on directional vector data processed from the IMU. We evaluate both schemes for the effects of orientation, size, and data density on their accuracies. We further conduct an in-depth analysis of the sources of motion deviations in the ring data as compared to the ground truth finger movement data. Overall, Asterisk achieves a 95% accuracy for an information capacity of 16.8 million possible sequences.",

But while applications authored with Mavo allow users to edit individual data items, they do not offer any programmatic data actions that can act in customizable ways on large collections of data simultaneously or that modify data according to a computation. We explore an extension to the Mavo language that enables non-programmers to author these richer data update actions. We show that it lets authors create a more powerful set of applications than they could previously, while adding little additional complexity to the authoring process. Through user evaluations, we assess how closely our data update syntax matches how novice authors would instinctively express such actions, and how well they are able to use the syntax we provided.",

I/O Braid senses proximity, touch, and twist through a spiraling, repeating braiding topology of touch matrices. This sensing topology is uniquely scalable, requiring only a few sensing lines to cover the whole length of a cord. The same topology allows us to embed fiber optic strands to integrate co-located visual feedback.\n\nWe provide an overview of the enabling braiding techniques, design considerations, and approaches to gesture detection. These allow us to derive a set of interaction techniques, which we demonstrate with different form factors and capabilities. Our applications illustrate how I/O Braid can invisibly augment everyday objects, such as  touch-sensitive headphones and interactive drawstrings on garments, while enabling discoverability and feedback through embedded light sources.

This paper presents WiFröst , a new approach for debugging these systems using instrumentation that spans from the device itself, to its communication API, to the wireless router and back-end server.

Hand-to-face gestures have been proposed as a way to add input expressivity while keeping control movements unobtrusive. To better understand how to design such techniques, we describe an elicitation study conducted in a busy public space in which pairs of users were asked to generate unobtrusive, socially acceptable hand-to-face input actions. Based on the results, we describe five design strategies: miniaturizing, obfuscating, screening, camouflaging and re-purposing. We instantiate these strategies in two hand-to-face input prototypes, one based on touches to the ear and the other based on touches of the thumbnail to the chin or cheek. Performance assessments characterize time and error rates with these devices. The paper closes with a validation study in which pairs of users experience the prototypes in a public setting and we gather data on the social acceptability of the designs and reflect on the effectiveness of the different strategies.",

        "abstract": "Haptic feedback in VR is important for realistic simulation in virtual reality.  However, recreating the haptic experience for hand tools in VR traditionally requires hardware with precise actuators, adding complexity to the system.  We propose Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting, an interaction technique that provides a realistic haptic experience for grabbing tools using only passive mechanisms.  This technique leverages the ungrounded feedback inherent in grabbing tools combined with dynamic visual adjustments of their position in virtual reality to create an illusion of physical presence for virtual objects.  To demonstrate the capabilities of this technique, we created VR Grabbers, an exemplary passive VR controller, similar to training chopsticks, with haptic feedback for precise object selection and manipulation. \n\nWe conducted two user studies based on VR Grabbers.  The first study probed the perceptual limits of the illusion; we found that the maximum position difference between the virtual and physical world acceptable to the user is (-1.48, 1.95) cm.  The second study showed that task performance of the VR Grabbers controller with Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting enabled outperforms the same controller with Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting disabled. \n",

        "abstract": "We make touch input by physically colliding an end effector (e.g., a body part or a stylus) with a touch surface. Prior studies have examined the use of kinematic variables of collision between objects, such as position, velocity, force, and impact. However, the nature of the collision can be understood more thoroughly by considering the known physical relationships that exist between directly measurable variables (i.e., kinetics). Based on this collision kinetics, this study proposes a novel touch technique called FDSense. By simultaneously observing the force and contact area measured from the touchpad, FDSense allows estimation of the Young’s modulus and stiffness of the object being contacted. Our technical evaluation showed that FDSense could effectively estimate the Young’s modulus of end effectors made of various materials, and the stiffness of each part of the human hand. Two applications using FDSense were demonstrated, for digital painting and digital instruments, where the result of the expression varies significantly depending on the elasticity of the end effector. In a following informal study, participants assessed the technique positively.",

Our results show that Tacttoo retains the natural tactile acuity similar to bare skin while delivering high-density tactile output.\nWe present the fabrication of customized Tacttoo tattoos using DIY tools and contribute a mechanism for consistent electro-tactile operation on the skin.\nMoreover, we explore new interactive scenarios that are enabled by Tacttoo. Applications in tactile augmented reality and on-skin interaction benefit from a seamless augmentation of real-world tactile cues with computer-generated stimuli.

While these delays are steadily addressed by hardware and software improvements, it is at a decelerating pace. In parallel, short-term input prediction has shown promising results in recent years, in both research and industry, as an addition to these efforts. We describe a new prediction algorithm for direct touch devices based on (i) a state-of-the-art finite-time derivative estimator, (ii) a smoothing mechanism based on input speed, and (iii) a post-filtering of the prediction in two steps. Using both a pre-existing dataset of touch input as benchmark, and subjective data from a new user study, we show that this new predictor outperforms the predictors currently available in the literature and industry, based on metrics that model user-defined negative side-effects caused by input prediction. In particular, we show that our predictor can predict up to 2 or 3 times further than existing techniques with minimal negative side-effects.",

In this paper, we explore the body's modality of itching as a way to provide such natural feedback. We create itching sensations via low-current electric stimulation, which allows us to quickly generate this sensation on demand. In a first study we explore the design space around itching and how changes in stimulation parameters influence the resulting sensation. In a second study we compare vibration feedback and itching integrated in a smartwatch form factor.

        "abstract": "When developing a real-walking virtual reality experience, designers generally create virtual locations to fit a specific tracking volume. Unfortunately, this prevents the resulting experience from running on a smaller or differently shaped tracking volume. To address this, we present a software system called Scenograph. The core of Scenograph is a tracking volume-independent representation of real-walking experiences. Scenograph instantiates the experience to a tracking volume of given size and shape by splitting the locations into smaller ones while maintaining narrative structure. In our user study, participants’ ratings of realism decreased significantly when existing techniques were used to map a 25m2 experience to 9m2 and an L-shaped 8m2 tracking volume. In contrast, ratings did not differ when Scenograph was used to instantiate the experience.",

The core of RESi builds on a newly designed yarn, which features conductive and resistive properties. We run a technical study to characterize the behaviour of the yarn and to determine the sensing principle. We demonstrate how the yarn can be used as a pressure sensor and discuss how specific issues, such as connecting the soft textile sensor with the rigid electronics can be solved. In addition, we present a platform-independent API that allows rapid prototyping. To show its versatility, we present applications developed with different textile manufacturing techniques, including hand sewing, machine sewing, and weaving. RESi is a novel technology, enabling textile pressure sensing to augment everyday objects with interactive capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Many web pages developed today require navigation by visual interaction—seeing,  hovering, pointing,  clicking, and dragging with the mouse over dynamic page content.  These forms of interaction are increasingly popular as developer trends have moved from static, logically structured pages to dynamic, interactive pages. However, they are also often inaccessible to blind web users who tend to rely on keyboard-based  screen  readers  to  navigate  the  web. Despite  existing web accessibility standards, engineering web pages to be equally accessible via both keyboard and visuomotor mouse-based interactions is often not a priority for developers. Improving access to this kind of visual and interactive web content has been a long-standing  goal of HCI researchers, but the barriers have proven to be too varied and unpredictable to be overcome by some of the proposed solutions: promoting  guidelines and  best  practices,  automatically  generating accessible versions of pre-exisiting web pages, or developing human-assisted solutions, such as screen and cursor-sharing, which  tend  to  diminish  an  end  user’s  agency. In this paper we present a real-time, collaborative approach to helping blind web users overcome inaccessible parts of existing web pages.  We introduce *Arboretum*, a new architecture that enables  any  web user to seamlessly hand off controlled parts of their browsing session to remote users, while maintaining control over the interface via a \"propose and accept/reject\" mechanism. We  illustrate  the  benefit of Arboretum by using it to implement *Arbility*, a browser that allows blind users to hand off targeted visual interaction tasks to remote crowd workers. We  evaluate the entire system in a study  with 9 blind web users, showing that Arbility allows them to interact with web content that was previously difficult to access via a screen reader alone.",

Although the data captured during this interaction mining is descriptive, it does not expose the design semantics of UIs: what elements on the screen mean and how they are used. This paper introduces an automatic approach for generating semantic annotations for mobile app UIs. Through an iterative open coding of 73k UI elements and 720 screens, we contribute a lexical database of 25 types of UI components, 197 text button concepts, and 135 icon classes shared across apps. We use this labeled data to learn code-based patterns to detect UI components and to train a convolutional neural network that distinguishes between icon classes with 94% accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach at scale, we compute semantic annotations for the 72k unique UIs in the Rico dataset, assigning labels for 78% of the total visible, non-redundant elements.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present Touch+Finger, a new interaction technique that augments touch input with multi-finger gestures for rich and expressive interaction. The main idea is that while one finger is engaged in a touch event, a user can leverage the remaining fingers, the “idle” fingers, to perform a variety of hand poses or in-air gestures to extend touch-based user interface capabilities. To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.",

Aside from being kept as memories, photo presentations such as slideshows are also shown to others who have not visited the location to try to convey the experience.However, a slideshow alone is limited in conveying the broader spatial context, and thus the feeling of presence in beautiful natural scenery is lost. We address this by presenting the photographs as part of an immersive experience. We introduce an automated pipeline for aligning photographs with a digital terrain model. From this geographic registration, we produce immersive presentations which are viewed either passively as a video, or interactively in virtual reality. Our experimental evaluation verifies that this new mode of presentation successfully conveys the spatial context of the scene and is enjoyable to users.",

To provide rich interactions with the text within screencasts, there are emerging platforms that support text-based screencasts by recording every character insertion and deletion from the creator and reconstructing its playback on the viewer's screen. However, these platforms lack support for non-linear editing of screencasts, which involves manipulating a sequence of text editing operations. Since text editing operations are tightly coupled in sequence, modifying an arbitrary part of the sequence often creates ambiguity that yields multiple possible results that require user's choice for resolution.\nWe present an editing tool with a non-linear editing algorithm for text-based screencasts. The tool allows users to edit any arbitrary part of a text-based screencast while preserving the overall consistency of the screencast. In an exploratory user study, all subjects successfully carried out a variety of screencast editing tasks using our prototype screencast editor.",

        "abstract": "From smart toys and household appliances to personal robots, electromechanical devices play an increasingly important role in our daily lives. Rather than relying on gadgets that are mass-produced, our goal is to enable casual users to custom-design such devices based on their own needs and preferences. To this end, we present a computational design system that leverages the power of digital fabrication and the emergence of affordable electronics such as sensors and microcontrollers. The input to our system consists of a 3D representation of the desired device's shape, and a set of user-preferred off-the-shelf components. Based on this input, our method generates an optimized, 3D printable enclosure that can house the required components. To create these designs automatically, we formalize a new spatio-temporal model that captures the entire assembly process, including the placement of the components within the device, mounting structures and attachment strategies, the order in which components must be inserted, and collision-free assembly paths. Using this model as a technical core, we then leverage engineering design guidelines and efficient numerical techniques to optimize device designs. In a user study, which also highlights the challenges of designing such devices, we find our system to be effective in reducing the entry barriers faced by casual users in creating such devices. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by designing and fabricating three devices with diverse functionalities.",

Our interface design utilizes a novel compact mechanism to provide haptic information to the palm. Also, we propose a haptic rendering strategy to calculate haptic feedback continuously. We demonstrate that cutaneous feedback on the palm improves the haptic perception of a large virtual object compared to when there is only kinesthetic feedback to the fingers.",

        "abstract": "We introduce DextrES, a flexible and wearable haptic glove which integrates both kinesthetic and cutaneous feedback in a thin and light form factor (weight is less than 8g). \nOur approach is based on an electrostatic clutch generating up to 20 N of holding force on each finger by modulating the electrostatic attraction between flexible elastic metal strips to generate an electrically-controlled friction force. We harness the resulting braking force to rapidly render on-demand kinesthetic feedback. The electrostatic brake is mounted onto the the index finger and thumb via modular 3D printed articulated guides which allow the metal strips to glide smoothly.  Cutaneous feedback is provided via piezo actuators at the fingertips. We demonstrate that our approach can provide rich haptic feedback under dexterous articulation of the user's hands and provides effective haptic feedback across a variety of different grasps. A controlled experiment indicates that DextrES improves the grasping precision for different types of virtual objects. Finally, we report on results of a psycho-physical study which identifies discrimination thresholds for different levels of holding force.  ",

        "abstract": "We present GridDrones, a self-levitating programmable matter platform that can be used for representing 2.5D voxel grid relief maps capable of rendering unsupported structures and 3D transformations. GridDrones consists of cube-shaped nanocopters that can be placed in a volumetric 1xnxn mid-air grid, which is demonstrated here with 15 voxels. The number of voxels and scale is only limited by the size of the room and budget. Grid deformations can be applied interactively to this voxel lattice by manually selecting a set of voxels, then assigning a continuous topological relationship between voxel sets that determines how voxels move in relation to each other and manually drawing out selected voxels from the lattice structure. Using this simple technique, it is possible to create unsupported structures that can be translated and oriented freely in 3D. Shape transformations can also be recorded to allow for simple physical shape morphing animations. This work extends previous work on selection and editing techniques for 3D user interfaces. ",

        "abstract": "Fact-checking, the task of assessing the veracity of claims, is an important, timely, and challenging problem. While many automated fact-checking systems have been recently proposed, the human side of the partnership has been largely neglected: how might people understand, interact with, and establish trust with an AI fact-checking system? Does such a system actually help people better assess the factuality of claims? In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative approach to fact-checking, blending human knowledge and experience with the efficiency and scalability of automated information retrieval and ML. In a user study in which participants used our system to aid their own assessment of claims, our results suggest that individuals tend to trust the system: participant accuracy assessing claims improved when exposed to correct model predictions. However, this trust perhaps goes too far: when the model was wrong, exposure to its predictions often degraded human accuracy. Participants given the option to interact with these incorrect predictions were often able improve their own performance. This suggests that transparent models are key to facilitating effective human interaction with fallible AI models.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces Dynamic 3D Printing, a fast and reconstructable shape formation system. Dynamic 3D Printing can assemble an arbitrary three-dimensional shape from a large number of small physical elements. Also, it can disassemble the shape back to elements and reconstruct a new shape. Dynamic 3D Printing combines the capabilities of 3D printers and shape displays: Like conventional 3D printing, it can generate arbitrary and graspable three-dimensional shapes, while allowing shapes to be rapidly formed and reformed as in a shape display. To demonstrate the idea, we describe the design and implementation of Dynablock, a working prototype of a dynamic 3D printer. Dynablock can form a three-dimensional shape in seconds by assembling 3,000 9 mm blocks, leveraging a 24 x 16 pin-based shape display as a parallel assembler. Dynamic 3D printing is a step toward achieving our long-term vision in which 3D printing becomes an interactive medium, rather than the means for fabrication that it is today. In this paper, we explore possibilities for this vision by illustrating application scenarios that are difficult to achieve with conventional 3D printing or shape display systems.",

To address this gap, we propose HydroRing, an unobtrusive, finger-worn device that can provide the tactile sensations of pressure, vibration, and temperature on the fingertip, enabling mixed-reality haptic interactions. Different from previous explorations, HydroRing in active mode delivers sensations using liquid travelling through a thin, flexible latex tube worn across the fingerpad, and has minimal impact on a user’s dexterity and their perception of stimuli in passive mode. Two studies evaluated participants’ ability to perceive and recognize sensations generated by the device, as well as their ability to perceive physical stimuli while wearing the device. We conclude by exploring several applications leveraging this mixed-reality haptics approach.",

Professional webpages embed these design patterns and could serve as rich learning materials, but their stylesheets are complex and difficult for novices to understand. This paper presents Ply, a CSS inspection tool that helps novices use their visual intuition to make sense of professional webpages. We introduce a new emph{visual relevance testing} technique to identify properties that have visual effects on the page, which Ply uses to hide visually irrelevant code and surface unintuitive relationships between properties. In user studies, Ply helped novice developers replicate complex web features 50% faster than those using Chrome Developer Tools, and allowed novices to recognize and explain unfamiliar concepts. These results show that visual inspection tools can support learning from complex professional webpages, even for novice developers.",

While popular, such explicit knowledge resources have many inconsistencies and omissions, use static illustrations, and cannot adapt to drop-in makers or a maker's mistakes. To overcome many of these issues, this work presents Automatics, a novel explicit knowledge resource system that dynamically generates fabrication activities for one or more makers based on their current environmental and fabrication context. Automatics assigns tasks to makers based on the past tools and components the maker was working with, enables makers to recover from mistakes through model regeneration, suggests alternative tools if a needed tool is unavailable or in use, and allows multiple makers to drop-in throughout a fabrication activity. Initial usage and feedback from novice makers showed that Automatics increases the number of tasks that can be completed compared to paper instructions, decreases frustration, and improves one's understanding of the global context of assigned tasks during fabrication activities.",

We review these methods and identify three major problems. First, we show that raw agreement rates disregard agreement that occurs by chance and do not reliably capture how participants distinguish among referents. Second, we explain why current recommendations on how to interpret agreement scores rely on problematic assumptions. Third, we demonstrate that significance tests for comparing agreement rates, either within or between participants, yield large Type I error rates (>40% for α =.05). As alternatives, we present agreement indices that are routinely used in inter-rater reliability studies. We discuss how to apply them to gesture elicitation studies. We also demonstrate how to use common resampling techniques to support statistical inference with interval estimates. We apply these methods to reanalyze and reinterpret the findings of four gesture elicitation studies.",

The results did not show significant differences between the two versions, but produced interesting insights. Based on the findings, we provide design guidelines for collaborative AR systems. ",

        "abstract": "Across many domains, interactive systems either make decisions for us autonomously or yield decision-making authority to us and play a supporting role. However, many settings, such as those in education or the workplace, benefit from sharing this autonomy between the user and the system, and thus from a system that adapts to them over time. In this paper, we pursue two primary research questions: (1) How do we design interfaces to share autonomy between the user and the system? (2) How does shared autonomy alter a user\"s perception of a system? We present SharedKeys, an interactive shared autonomy system for piano instruction that plays different video segments of a piece for students to emulate and practice. Underlying our approach to shared autonomy is a mixed-observability Markov decision process that estimates a user\"s desired autonomy level based on her performance and attentiveness. Pilot studies revealed that students sharing autonomy with the system learned more quickly and perceived the system as more intelligent. ",

Slides convey the main points of the lecture visually, while the instructor's narration adds detailed verbal explanations to each item in the slide. We call the link between a slide item and the corresponding part of the narration a reference. In order to assess the feasibility of reference-based interaction techniques for watching videos, we introduce DynamicSlide, a video processing system that automatically extracts references from slide-based lecture videos and a video player. The system incorporates a set of reference-based techniques: emphasizing the current item in the slide that is being explained, enabling item-based navigation, and enabling item-based note-taking. Our pipeline correctly finds 79% of the references in a set of five videos with 141 references. Results from a user study suggest that DynamicSlide's features improve the learner's video browsing and navigation experience.",

        "abstract": "Despite advances in machine learning and deep neural networks, there is still a huge gap between machine and human image understanding. One of the causes is the annotation process used to label training images. In most image categorization tasks, there is a fundamental ambiguity between some image categories and the underlying class probability differs from very obvious cases to ambiguous ones. However, current machine learning systems and applications usually work with discrete annotation processes and the training labels do not reflect this ambiguity. To address this issue, we propose an new image annotation framework where labeling incorporates human gaze behavior. In this framework, gaze behavior is used to predict image labeling difficulty. The image classifier is then trained with sample weights defined by the predicted difficulty. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on four-class image classification tasks.",

This can be solved using active acoustic sensing; however, this method is not suitable for emitting some vibrations around the head in terms of the influence of audition. Therefore, we propose a method for estimating head poses using body-conducted sound naturally and regularly generated in the human body.

Assisting technologies in form of augmented reality (AR) have previously been applied to support cognitively impaired users during IADLs.  In most cases, instructions were provided locally via projection or a head-mounted display (HMD) but lacked an incentive mechanism and the flexibility to support a broad range of use-cases. To provide users and therapists with a holistic solution, we propose cARe, a framework that can be easily adapted by therapists to various use-cases without any programming knowledge.  Users are then guided through manual processes with localized visual and auditory cues that are rendered by an HMD. Our ongoing user study indicates that users are more comfortable and successful in cooking with cARe as compared to a printed recipe, which promises a more dignified and autonomous living for dementia patients.",

        "abstract": "Research has been done in sophisticated notifications, still, devices today mainly stick to a binary level of information, while they are either attention drawing or silent. We propose scalable notifications, which adjust the intensity level reaching from subtle to obtrusive and even going beyond that level while forcing the user to take action. To illustrate the technical feasibility and validity of this concept, we developed three prototypes. The prototypes provided mechano-pressure, thermal, and electrical feedback, which were evaluated in different lab studies. Our first prototype provides subtle poking through to high and frequent pressure on the user’s spine, which significantly improves back posture. In a second scenario, the user is able to perceive the overuse of a drill by an increased temperature on the palm of a hand until the heat is intolerable, forcing the user to eventually put down the tool. The last application comprises of a speed control in a driving simulation, while electric muscle stimulation on the users’ legs, conveys information on changing the car’s speed by a perceived tingling until the system forces the foot to move involuntarily. In conclusion, all studies’ findings support the feasibility of our concept of a scalable notification system, including the system forcing an intervention.",

Pen-and-paper role-playing games (P&P RPG) are a concept known since the early 1970s. Since then, the genre has attracted a massive community of players while branching out into several genres and P&P RPG systems to choose from. Due to the highly interactive and dynamic nature of the game, a participants individual impact on narrative and interactive aspects of the game is extremely high. The diversity of scenarios within this context unfold a variety of players needs, as well as factors limiting and enhancing game-play. Companion offers an audio management workspace for creation and playback of soundscapes based on visual layouting. It supports interactive image presentation and map exploration which can incorporate input from any device providing TUIO tracking data. Additionally, a mobile app was developed to be used as a remote control for media activation on the desktop host. ",

        "abstract": "Learning new motor skills is a problem that people are constantly confronted with (e.g. to learn a new kind of sport). In our work, we investigate to which extent the learning\nprocess of a motor sequence can be optimized with the help of Augmented Reality as a technical assistant. Therefore, we propose an approach that divides the problem into three tasks: (1) the tracking of the necessary movements, (2) the creation of a model that calculates possible deviations and (3) the implementation of a visual feedback system. To evaluate our approach, we implemented the idea by using infrared depth sensors and an Augmented Reality head-mounted device (HoloLens). Our results show that the system can give an efficient assistance for the correct height of a throw with one ball. Furthermore, it provides a basis for the support of a complete juggling sequence.",

Theses biases can be informed by a multitude of non-verbal cues such as voice pitch and voice volume. This project explores how haptic effects, generated from speech, could attenuate listeners' perceived voice-related biases formed from a speaker's voice pitch. Promising preliminary results collected during a decision-making task suggest that the speech to haptic mapping and vibration delivery mechanism employed does attenuate voice-related biases. Accordingly, it is anticipated that such a system could be introduced in the workplace to equalize people's contribution opportunities and to create a more inclusive environment by reversing voice-related biases.",

        "abstract": "To filter and shut out an increasingly loud environment, many resort to the use of personal audio technology. They drown out unwanted sounds, by wearing headphones. This uniform interaction with all surrounding sounds can have a negative impact on social relations and situational awareness. Leveraging mediation through smarter headphones, users gain more agency over their sense of hearing: For instance by being able to selectively alter the volume and other features of specific sounds, without losing the ability to add media.  In this work, we propose the vision of interactive auditory mediated reality (AMR). To understand users' attitude and requirements, we conducted a week-long event sampling study (n = 12), where users recorded and rated sources (n = 225) which they would like to mute, amplify or turn down. The results indicate that besides muting, a distinct, \"quiet-but-audible\" volume exists. It caters to two requirements at the same time: aesthetics/comfort and information acquisition.",

        "abstract": "One of the main drawbacks of the fixation-based gaze interfaces is that they are unable to distinguish top-down attention (or selection, a gaze with a purpose) from stimulus driven bottom-up attention (or navigation, a stare without any intentions) without time durations or unnatural eye movements. We found that using the bistable image called the Necker's cube as a button user interface (UI) helps to remedy the limitation. When users switch two rivaling percepts of the Necker's cube at will, unique eye movements are triggered and these characteristics can be used to indicate a button press or a selecting action. In this paper, we introduce (1) the cognitive phenomenon called \"percept switch\" for gaze interaction, and (2) propose \"perceptual switch\" or the Necker's cube user interface (UI) which uses \"percept switch\" as the indication of a selection. Our preliminary experiment confirms that perceptual switch can be used to distinguish voluntary gaze selection from random navigation, and discusses that the visual elements of the Necker's cube such as size and biased visual cues could be adjusted for the optimal use of individual users.",

        "abstract": "Online crowds, with their large numbers and diversity, show great potential for creativity, particularly during large-scale brainstorming sessions. Research has explored different ways of augmenting this creativity, such as showing ideators some form of inspiration to get them to explore more categories or generate more ideas. The mechanisms used to select which inspirations are shown to ideators thus far have been focused on characteristics of the inspirations rather than on ideators. This can hinder their effect, as creativity research has shown that ideators have unique cognitive structures and may therefore be better inspired by some ideas rather than others. We introduce CrowdMuse, an adaptive system for supporting large scale brainstorming. The system models ideators based on their past ideas and adapts the system views and inspiration mechanisms accordingly. An evaluation of this system could inform how to better individually support ideators.",

To balance between them, active authentication is one way to overcome the problem. In this paper, we tackle to improve the accuracy of active authentication by adopting online learning with touch pressure. In recent years, it becomes easy to use the smartphones equipped with pressure sensor so that we have confirmed the effectiveness of adopting the touch pressure as one of the features to authenticate. Our experiments adopting online AROW algorithm with touch pressure show that equal error rate (EER), where the miss rate and false rate are equal, is reduced up to one-fifth by adding touch pressure feature. Moreover, we have confirmed that training with the data from both sitting posture and prone posture archives the best when testing variety of postures including sitting, standing and prone, which achieves EER up to 0.14%.",

This display provides three-way observation for omnidirectional images. DisplayBowl allows users to observe an omnidirectional image by looking the image from above. In addition, users can see it with a first-person-viewpoint, by looking into the inside of the hemispherical surface from diagonally above. Furthermore, by observing both the inside and the outside of the hemispherical surface at the same time from obliquely above, it is possible to observe it by a pseudo third-person-viewpoint, like watching the drone obliquely from behind. These ways of viewing solve the problem of inability of pilots controlling a remote vehicle such as a drone to notice what happens behind them, which happen with conventional displays such as flat displays and head mounted displays.",

We recorded 18 participants preforming a simple retrieval task in two phases; an initial and a learning phase where the stretch arm was disabled and enabled respectively.

While we are able to interpret gaze as a sign of interest or reluctance, conventional user interfaces do not yet possess this possible benefit. In our work, we evaluate to what degree fixation-based gaze metrics can be used to infer a user's personal interest in the displayed content. We report on a study (N=18) where participants were presented with a grid array of different images, whilst being recorded for gaze behavior. Our system calculated a ranking for shown images based on gaze metrics. We found that all metrics are effective indicators of the participants' interest by analyzing their agreement with regard to the system's ranking. In an evaluation in a museum, we found that this translates to in-the-wild scenarios despite environmental constraints, such as limited data accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Physical buttons provide rich force characteristics during the travel range, which are commonly described in the form of force-displacement curves. These force characteristics play an important role in the users' experiences while pressing a button. However, due to lack of proper tools to dynamically render various force-displacement curves, little literature has tried iterative button design improvement. This paper presents Button Simulator, a low-cost 3D printed physical button capable of displaying any force-displacement curves, with limited average error offset around .034 N. By reading the force-displacement curves of existing push-buttons, we can easily replicate the force characteristics from any buttons onto our Button Simulator. One can even go beyond existing buttons and design non-existent ones as the form of arbitrary force-displacement curves; then use Button Simulator to render the sensation. This project will be open-sourced and the implementation details will be released. Our system can be a useful tool for future researchers, designers, and makers to investigate rich and dynamic button\"s force design.",

        "abstract": "Eye tracking is expected to become an integral part of future augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) given that it can easily be integrated into existing hardware and provides a versatile interaction modality. To augment objects in the real world, AR HMDs require a three-dimensional understanding of the scene, which is currently solved using depth cameras. In this work we aim to explore how 3D gaze data can be used to enhance scene understanding for AR HMDs by envisioning a symbiotic human-machine depth camera, fusing depth data with 3D gaze information. We present a first proof of concept, exploring to what extend we are able to recognise what a user is looking at by plotting 3D gaze data. To measure 3D gaze, we implemented a vergence-based algorithm and built an eye tracking setup consisting of a Pupil Labs headset and an OptiTrack motion capture system, allowing us to measure 3D gaze inside a 50x50x50 cm volume. We show first 3D gaze plots of \"gazed-at\" objects and describe our vision of a symbiotic human-machine depth camera that combines a depth camera and human 3D gaze information.",

Safety-critical scenarios require trained and expensive personnel to navigate quadcopters through crucial flight paths within narrow spaces. To simplify the input and manual operation of quadcopters, we present DroneCTRL, a tangible pointing device to navigate quadcopters. DroneCTRL resembles a remote control including optional visual feedback by a laser pointer and tangibility to improve the quadcopter control usability for non-expert users. In a preliminary user study, we compare the efficiency of hardware and software-based controller with DroneCTRL.

As a case study, we share tactics used and strategies followed to conduct a pop-up style study of 'A robotic mailbox to support and raise awareness about homelessness.'

I propose a new era of self-sustainable computing through the development of computational materials that can be truly woven into thefabricofeverydaylifeandcreatedecadesofinspirationfor new researchers across a variety of disciplines. I will deﬁne and demonstrate some initial examples of computational materials and explain why self-sustainable computing provides a compelling vision for computing in a post-Moore’s Law world.",

        "abstract": "Suppose we could create interactive visualizations in the air during our day to day conversations? In the next few years, mixed reality technologies will make this possible. When that happens, how might language itself evolve? We describe a plan to help guide that evolution. If the capability to share visual communication under gestural control leads to a change in natural language itself, then future generations of children will grow up in a richer world, with powers of natural language-based communication that we now can only begin to envision. The resulting communicative power-up for coming generations may be as fundamental and paradigm changing as was the development of written language itself 5,000 years ago. ",
